                <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock</em> stands as an interesting time capsule into the forceful brutality of colonialism, which endures into the modern era. While 
                undoubtedly the roots of the doctrine of plenary power are shaky at best, it has nonetheless been used throughout Native law to support measures 
                both harmful and helpful to Natives. While its intertwinement with much of federal law makes it nearly impossible to overturn, understanding <em>Lone 
                Wolf</em> can help mitigate future harm and create more opportunities to support Natives after a long history of oppression.

                Learning about this case helped me better understand the following era of Congressional abuse of power to force Natives into boarding schools, 
                removal from reservations, and assimilation. While researching it, I found a lot of information on the surrounding events. As I dug deeper, I realized 
                how interconnected Native history is, for there were, in truth, innumerable other events to explore surrounding this one moment. While I had 
                originally planned to include more information on the Marshall Trilogy, I realized that the Dawes Act and <em>Kagama</em> were far more important for 
                explaining the decision in <em>Lone Wolf</em>. I also considered including the Cheyenne and Arapaho into the timeline as they were also affected by its 
                outcomes; however, they seemed slightly too far outside the story I wanted to tell. In conclusion, this final project provided an opportunity to explore 
                an area of history that I had very little knowledge of beforehand, and I learned a great deal about the forceful treaties imposed to take away Native 
                sovereignty, until relatively recent efforts to restore it have been successful.
