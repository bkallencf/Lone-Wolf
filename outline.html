        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div id="introduction">
            <p>
                <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock</em> stands as an interesting time capsule into the forceful brutality of colonialism, which endures into the modern era. While 
                undoubtedly the roots of the doctrine of plenary power are shaky at best, it has nonetheless been used throughout Native law to support measures 
                both harmful and helpful to Natives. While its intertwinement with much of federal law makes it nearly impossible to overturn, understanding <em>Lone 
                Wolf</em> can help mitigate future harm and create more opportunities to support Natives after a long history of oppression.
            </p>
            <p>
                Learning about this case helped me better understand the following era of Congressional abuse of power to force Natives into boarding schools, 
                removal from reservations, and assimilation. While researching it, I found a lot of information on the surrounding events. As I dug deeper, I realized 
                how interconnected Native history is, for there were, in truth, innumerable other events to explore surrounding this one moment. While I had 
                originally planned to include more information on the Marshall Trilogy, I realized that the Dawes Act and <em>Kagama</em> were far more important for 
                explaining the decision in <em>Lone Wolf</em>. I also considered including the Cheyenne and Arapaho into the timeline as they were also affected by its 
                outcomes; however, they seemed slightly too far outside the story I wanted to tell. In conclusion, this final project provided an opportunity to explore 
                an area of history that I had very little knowledge of beforehand, and I learned a great deal about the forceful treaties imposed to take away Native 
                sovereignty, until relatively recent efforts to restore it have been successful.

                        <li><em>United States v. Kagama (1886)</em> gave Congress some power over the reservations</li>

                        <li>The General Allotment Act of 1887 spurred on an era of allotment where Congress became more aggressive in their attempts to seize lands</li>
                        <li>The Jerome Commission came to the Kiowa reservation in 1892 to negotiate a new treaty for their surplus lands</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Lied about terms of the treaty, threatened Natives, and forged signatures but ended up with less than ¾ of all Kiowa male signatures</li>
                            </ol>
                        <li>Congress repeatedly tried to pass the 1892 treaty</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Early attempts by Kiowa and Comanche to stop the treaty worked in delaying it</li>
                                <li>A new act to enact the treaty was passed on June 6, 1900</li>
                            </ol>
                    </ol>
                <li>The Kiowa chief, Lone Wolf the younger, sued Ethan Hitchcock for illegaly passing the treaty</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The treaty breached Articles II, VI, and XII of the treaty</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Sued in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia on June 6, 1902 and lost</li>
                                <li>Appealed to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals and lost again</li>
                            </ol>
                        <li>Lone Wolf requested an injunction to deny access to the surplus lands while appealing to the Supreme Court</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>The reuqest was denied and settlers flooded onto the reservation on August 6</li>
                            </ol>
                        <li>On October 23 the US Supreme Court heard the case and unanimously ruled against Lone Wolf on January 5, 1903</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Congress acted in "perfectly good faith" and was not subject to judicial overview, thereby possessing plenary powers over Native lands</li>
                                <li>Congress possessed the doctrine of discovery and Natives were only stewards of the land according to the Marshall Trilogy</li>
                            </ol>
                    </ol>
                <li>The result of plenary power strengthened Congress' claims over Native lands and influences much of federal Native policy today</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>There were some later successes, such as in 1955, the Kiowa received $2 million as some compensation</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Throughout the 1970s, Natives removed many barriers, giving them access to the right to vote</li>
                                <li>Further cases made Congress answer more to the Courts and redefined the plenary power doctrine</li>
                                <li>Native Treaties started becoming once again enforceable as the USA and other countries had to abide by them</li>
                            </ol>
                        <li>Ultimately, however, plenary power continues to guide much of Native law and has never been repealed</li>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Congress uses the plenary power doctrine in addition to its other powers like the Indian Commerce Clause to push policy</li>
                                <li>While restrictions have been placed on the doctrine to attempt to redefine it, this has never truly stopped Congress from enacting policies</li>
                                <li>Understanding and remaining vigilant of the plenary power doctrine can prevent future oppression</li>
                            </ol>
                    </ol>
