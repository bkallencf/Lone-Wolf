            <p class="annotation">Commissioner David H. Jerome was the head of the Jerome Commission, which forcefully created a treaty with the Kiowa to eventually steal their lands. This engraving provides a visual to understand the commission, which ultimately started the case of <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock</em>.</p>

Hitchcock: Breaking the Treaties.” <em>In the Courts of the Conquerer: The 10 Worst Indian Law Cases Ever Decided</em>, Fulcrum Publishing, 2012, pp. 164–189. <em>ProQuest Ebook Central</em>, ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/sfsu/detail.action?docID=547517. Accessed 6 Aug. 2025.</p>
            <p class="annotation">Echo-Hawk details the events of the case, providing especially great insight to the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 and the outcomes of the case into the future. While future cases in the 1970s brought alternatives to make Congress beholden to the Courts, prior damages from the violation of treaties and unstoppable land seizures devastated Native communities. Additionally, it discusses the decision of giving Congress plenary powers with surrounding cases, including the Insular cases.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This image of Lone Wolf the younger showcases the Kiowa chief amidst his legal battles for his tribe’s sovereignty. Notably, in contrast to many perceptions of Natives as brutal savages, this image depicts Lone Wolf in a manner that was refined by Western standards.</p>

            <p class="annotation">Ishtani examines the doctrine of plenary power, originating from <em>Lone Wolf</em> and <em>Kagama</em> by looking at <em>Haaland v. Brackeen</em>. Ishtani categorizes the decision as a product of racist presumptions, and later looks at applications of the case in other cases to determine its constitutionality in them. In this manner, this source also defines some of the later limitations to plenary power, and argues against the inconsistencies in its usage.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This source provides key legal information about <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903)</em>, including the opinion of the justices. It provides background on the many iterations of the 1892 treaty and the contentions around it with specific timelines. The specific details provided of the case allow the wrongdoings of the case to be clearly evaluated. Examination of the source material provides a basis for outside opinions and implications of the landmark case.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This source provides the background and decision for <em>United States v. Kagama</em> which preceded <em>Lone Wolf</em> in setting up plenary power. Kagama murdered another Native, Iyouse, on the Hoopa reservation and was tried by Congress under the Major Crimes Act. However, Kagama argued that this was outside their jurisdiction. The Court ruled the Major Crimes Act was constitutional and gave Congress thr right to manage some laws on the reservations because they said tribal governments derived their power from Congress.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This source from the class readings provides a good overview to understand the Marshall Trilogy which became the foundation for the United States’ views of Native nations. In particular, <em>Johnson v. McIntosh (1823)</em> made Natives inhabitants of the lands and gave the doctrine of discovery.</p>

Accessed 6 Aug. 2025.</p>
            <p class="annotation">Pommersheim goes in detail to explain the 1887 General Allotment Act and the allotment culture which inspired the Jerome Commission. It also provides descriptions of the treaty’s path into and through Congress and the courts. By drawing parallels with other laws and cases, like <em>United States v. Kagama (1886)</em>, this source also provides context of how immigration and territorial expansion encouraged the justices’ decisions.</p>

            <p class="annotation">Steele addresses the plenary power doctrine and the Courts’ roles in Native affairs despite Congress holding the power to deal with them. This source gives context into how <em>Lone Wolf</em> shaped case law going forward. Steele also criticizes the Courts in oppressing Natives further by selectively ruling cases. Steele also indicates how the political question doctrine has taken away from Congress to confuse government power over Native affairs.</p>

            <p class="annotation">The Medicine Lodge Treaties moved the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. This painting, in particular, depicts the Kiowa chief Satanta at these negotiations. The Medicine Lodge Treaties were very important as the backbone of Lone Wolf’s legal justification in the courts. This painting provides a nice visual of this event.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This Medicine Lodge Treaty was used extensively in Lone Wolf’s argument against Ethan Hitchcock. While promising peace and land rights, Article II also gives undisturbed access to the land. Article VI guarantees 320 acres to the head of each family and 80 acres for people over 18. Finally, Article XII required ¾ of all Kiowa male adult signatures to change or create a new treaty.</p>
