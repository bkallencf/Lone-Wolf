Hitchcock: Breaking the Treaties.” <em>In the Courts of the Conquerer: The 10 Worst Indian Law Cases Ever Decided</em>, Fulcrum Publishing, 2012, pp. 164–189. <em>ProQuest Ebook Central</em>, ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/sfsu/detail.action?docID=547517. Accessed 6 August 2025.</p>
            <p class="annotation">Echo-Hawk details the events of the case, providing especially great insight to the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 and the outcomes of the case into the future. While future cases in the 1970s brought alternatives to make Congress beholden to the Courts, prior damages from the violation of treaties and unstoppable land seizures devastated Native communities. Additionally, it discusses the decision of giving Congress plenary powers with surrounding cases, including the Insular cases.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This source from the class readings provides a good overview to understand the Marshall Trilogy which became the foundation for the United States’ views of Native nations. In particular, <em>Johnson v. McIntosh (1823)</em> made Natives inhabitants of the lands and gave the doctrine of discovery.</p>

            <p class="annotation">Pommersheim goes in detail to explain the 1887 General Allotment Act and the allotment culture which inspired the Jerome Commission. It also provides descriptions of the treaty’s path into and through Congress and the courts. By drawing parallels with other laws and cases, like <em>United States v. Kagama (1886)</em>, this source also provides context of how immigration and territorial expansion encouraged the justices’ decisions.</p>
