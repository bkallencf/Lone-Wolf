Hitchcock: Breaking the Treaties.” In the Courts of the Conquerer: The 10 Worst Indian Law Cases Ever Decided, Fulcrum Publishing, 2012, pp. 164–189. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/sfsu/detail.action?docID=547517. Accessed 25 July 2025.</p>
            <p class="annotation">Echo-Hawk details the events of the case, providing especially great insight to the Medicine Lodge Treaty of 1867 and the outcomes of the case into the future. While future cases in the 1970s brought alternatives to make Congress beholden to the Courts, prior damages from the violation of treaties and unstoppable land seizures devastated Native communities. Additionally, it discusses the decision of giving Congress plenary powers with surrounding cases, including the Insular cases.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This source provides key legal information about Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903), including the opinion of the justices. It provides background on the many iterations of the 1892 treaty and the contentions around it with specific timelines. The specific details provided of the case allow the wrongdoings of the case to be clearly evaluated. Examination of the source material provides a basis for outside opinions and implications of the landmark case.</p>

            <p class="annotation">This source from the class readings provides a good overview to understand the Marshall Trilogy which became the foundation for the United States’ views of Native nations. In particular, Johnson v. McIntosh (1823) made Natives inhabitants of the lands and gave the doctrine of discovery.</p>

Hitchcock: The Birth of Plenary Power, Incorporation, and an Extraconstitutional Regime.” Broken Landscape: Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution, Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 134–160. ProQuest Ebook Central, https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/sfsu/detail.action?docID=472077. Accessed 25 July 2025.</p>
            <p class="annotation">Pommersheim goes in detail to explain the 1887 General Allotment Act and the allotment culture which inspired the Jerome Commission. It also provides descriptions of the treaty’s path into and through Congress and the courts. By drawing parallels with other laws and cases, like United States v. Kagama (1886), this source also provides context of how immigration and territorial expansion encouraged the justices’ decisions.</p>
