                    At the turn of the 20th century, as the USA sought to expand its lands, Congress began using its power to further encroach on Native lands. One 
                    such case, <em>Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903)</em>, sought to fight against these unjust seizures. Ultimately, the case gave Congress complete power to 
                    manage Native lands however they pleased without judicial oversight. This empowered Congress to be more aggressive in its land seizures and 
                    completely nullified the treaties whose power was already beginning to wane. Built upon the Marshall Trilogy, <em>United States v. Kagama (1886)</em>, and 
                    the colonialist attitude enforced by the Dawes Act, the plenary power endowed by the Court stood as a threat to Native sovereignty, which remains 
                    in the law.

        <h2>Plenary Power</h2>

                    The doctrine of plenary power is antithetical to the design of checks and balances proposed within the Constitution, yet it persists in law to this day. 
                    While it may not be used to remove Natives from their lands, it serves as a justification for much of federal Indian policy, including the Indian Child 
                    Welfare Act and around 111 cases (Ishtani and Fay). While Congress has additionally pulled its power from other parts of the Constitution, its 
                    unchecked plenary powers over Native affairs remain an underlying danger for Native sovereignty. Fortunately, all is not so downhearted as 
                    continued activism and decisions by the Court have questioned plenary power. Examining the plenary power doctrine has resulted in the 
                    paradoxical conclusion that Congress' power is plenary but not absolute, as it is constrained by the Constitution (Steele). However, these limits in 
                    actuality do little to prevent Congress' authority. Therefore, as long as the doctrine of plenary power exists within the law, permanent vigilance must 
                    be retained to prevent the violation of the rights and well-being of Native Americans.
